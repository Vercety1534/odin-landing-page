# odin-landing-page

This is the final project from the Foundations Courses - Flexbox, a part of The Odin Project.

The idea of this project is to code an entire web page just based off the screenshot of the expected design. It is expected to start with the basic HTML boilerplate, style it through CSS, and incorperate Flexbox.

I completed the project based on the example and the expanded it with stire content to make it feel like a real life project.
